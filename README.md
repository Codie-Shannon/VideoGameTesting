# Blackbox and Whitebox Testing
This GitHub repository consists of a Test Plan created in Microsoft Word and a Unit Test created in Unity. The purpose of these two documents is to test games for an old tutor. Unfortunately, only one of the games is available to download as the other video game is lost to history.


# Ball Game
In Roll a Ball, the player is a ball with the goal to get to the end of the level without falling off the path or else the player dies / despawns and must start from the beginning of the map until they can make it to the end.


# Shooter
In the shooter, the player was playing in a multiplayer team deathmatch with the target to get a certain number of kills before the other team.
